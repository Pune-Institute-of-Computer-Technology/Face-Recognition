# Face-Recognition Attendance System 

• Designed a curriculum-based project that was a face recognition-based attendance system with high-level security. The research was primarily concerned with using cutting-edge visual recognition algorithms using OpenCV
to detect faces and identify and validate faces by mapping facial features.

• To track student attendance at the college server, this face-recognition
model based on DNN Classification, employed a webcam to recognize faces
in real-time. The data was then recorded in a CSV file and updated at the
college server.



• Here's a demonstration of the project -
